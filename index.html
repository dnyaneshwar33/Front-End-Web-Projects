                Cricket is a popular team sport known for its strategic depth and rich history. It is played between two teams, typically composed of 11 players each, on a large oval field. The objective is to score runs while batting and to dismiss the opposing team's batsmen when bowling and fielding. Cricket is often celebrated for its various formats, its blend of individual and team performances, and the deep passion it inspires in fans around the world.            </p>

                Cricket is played with two primary roles: batsmen and bowlers. Batsmen try to score runs by hitting the ball delivered by the bowler and then running between two sets of stumps (wickets) at each end of the pitch. Meanwhile, bowlers aim to get the batsmen out through various means, such as by bowling them out, having them caught by fielders, or using tactics to induce mistakes. Fielders support the bowlers and try to stop the batsmen from scoring runs            </p>

                The Ashes is one of cricket's most prestigious and historic Test series. It is a biennial contest held between England and Australia, dating back to 1882. The name originated from a satirical obituary in The Sporting Times, humorously claiming that English cricket had died and "the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia."            </p>

            <h4>How are runs scored in cricket?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer ">
            <p>
                
                Runs are primarily scored when batsmen hit the ball and run between the wickets, crossing from one end to the other. Additionally, boundaries, including fours (when the ball reaches the boundary after bouncing) and sixes (when the ball clears the boundary on the full), award extra runs without the need to run.            </p>

        <div class="question">
            <h4> What are the various ways a batsman can be dismissed?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer ">
            <p>
               
                Batsmen can be dismissed through numerous methods, including being bowled (the ball hits the stumps), caught (a fielder catches the ball after the batsman hits it), run out (the fielding team successfully removes the bails before the batsman reaches the crease), stumped (the wicket-keeper removes the bails while the batsman is out of the crease), and leg before wicket (LBW, when the ball would have hit the stumps but for the leg obstruction).
